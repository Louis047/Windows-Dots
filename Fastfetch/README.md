Thanks to [ashish0kumar](https://github.com/ashish0kumar) for the fastfetch config, make a single change to it where it grabs the user's default cpu config instead of the hardcoded one. Make sure to check his dots [here](https://github.com/ashish0kumar/windots)

Config Location - `C:\Users\$USER\.config\fastfetch\`
