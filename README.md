# Windows-Dots
### Tools Used:
- [Yet Another Status Bar](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb) - polybar port to Windows, built using Python.
  
- [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) - i3-like window tiling manager, built using Rust.

- [GlazeWM Autotiler](https://github.com/orbi-tal/glaze-autotiler) - Implements a missing feature to `GlazeWM`: Tiling Layouts. Soon to be deprecated as they're going to be added in the next update.
  
- [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi) - Another Tiling Manager made using Rust, heard they making good progress in implementing animations with recent updates (might change to this and add the config later)

- [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) - If you've used Hyprland, you'll know it.
  
- [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) - Powetoys Run, but better. (Microsoft Ruined it with their new trash: `Command Plaette`)
  
- [WindHawk](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk) - Centralized Customization for Windows, made with love :)
  
- [Smooth-Scroll](https://www.smoothscroll.net/win/) - System-Level implementation for buttery-smooth scrolling. Sad that it's paid but I do appreciate the developer's work. Might as well support him by buying a license with my first salary :)

- [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) - Linux ricer's sex toy.

- [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) - Idk why people enjoy using this. Just kept it for preview sake.
