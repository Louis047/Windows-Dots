# Windows-Dots
### Tools Used:
- [Yet Another Status Bar](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb) - a status bar with customizations, built using Python.
  
- [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) - i3-like window tiling manager, built using Rust.

- [GlazeWM Autotiler](https://github.com/orbi-tal/glaze-autotiler) - Implements a missing feature to GlazeWM: `Tiling Layouts`. Soon to be deprecated as the functionality is about to be merged in the next update.
  
- [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi) - Another Tiling Manager made using Rust, with goodies like animations and better transparency support. Sure a hell to customize this.

- [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) - If you've used Hyprland, you'll know it.
  
- [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) - Powetoys Run, but better. (Microsoft Ruined it with their new trash: `Command Palette`)
  
- [WindHawk](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk) - Centralized Customization for Windows, made with love :). Every user should try this.
  
- [Smooth-Scroll](https://www.smoothscroll.net/win/) - System-Level implementation for buttery-smooth scrolling. Sad that it's paid but has a free trial upto 21 days. I do appreciate the developer's work. Might as well support him by buying a license with my first salary :)

- [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) - A ricer's sex toy.

- [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) - Idk why people enjoy using this. Just kept it for preview sake.

- [MacType](https://github.com/snowie2000/mactype) - If you love MacOS and want better font rendering, this software is a heaven. Recently brought back from dead. Really recommend this. (even though their website is dead, good to see this project active in github)
