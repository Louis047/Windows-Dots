Responsive Design\n\n#### Breakpoints:\n- Mobile: < 768px (priority)\n- Tablet: 768px - 1024px\n- Desktop: > 1024px\n\n#### Mobile Optimizations:\n- Collapsible sidebar\n- Touch-friendly button sizes\n- Swipe gestures where appropriate\n- Optimized charts for small screens\n\n### 8. Implementation Priorities\n\n#### Must Have (Core Demo):\n1. ✅ Login page with theme toggle\n2. ✅ Dashboard with charts and metrics\n3. ✅ Sidebar navigation\n4. ✅ Settings page with theme switcher\n5. ✅ Subscriptions list page\n6. ✅ Dark/Light mode toggle throughout\n\n#### Should Have (Enhanced Demo):\n7. ✅ Funds page with wallet\n8. ✅ Regional services page\n9. ✅ Add subscription modal\n10. ✅ User profile management\n\n#### Nice to Have (Polish):\n11. ✅ Bundle offers page\n12. ✅ Advanced filtering/sorting\n13. ✅ Transaction history\n14. ✅ Animations and micro-interactions\n\n### 9. Code Quality Requirements\n\n- **Clean, readable code** with proper component structure\n- **Reusable components** (Button, Card, Modal, etc.)\n- **Proper error handling** and loading states\n- **Accessibility features** (proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)\n- **Performance optimizations** (avoid unnecessary re-renders)\n\n### 10. Demo Data Examples\n\n```javascript\n// Sample subscription data structure\nconst sampleSubscriptions = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    name: \"Netflix\",\n    category: \"Entertainment\",\n    cost: 649,\n    billingCycle: \"monthly\",\n    nextBilling: \"2025-07-15\",\n    status: \"active\",\n    icon: \"🎬\"\n  },\n  // ... more subscriptions\n];\n\n// Sample expense data for charts\nconst monthlyExpenses = [\n  { month: \"Jan\", amount: 2400 },\n  { month: \"Feb\", amount: 2800 },\n  // ... more data\n];\n```\n\n## Deliverable\nCreate a single React component artifact that includes:\n1. Complete application with all required pages\n2. Smooth navigation between sections\n3. Working theme toggle\n4. Responsive design\n5. Sample data for demonstration\n6. Professional, polished appearance ready for demo\n\n## Success Criteria\nThe final application should:\n- ✅ Look professional and modern\n- ✅ Work smoothly on mobile and desktop\n- ✅ Have all core functionality working\n- ✅ Include realistic placeholder data\n- ✅ Support both dark and light themes\n- ✅ Be ready for immediate demo presentation\n\nStart with the login page and dashboard, then implement other sections based on priority. Focus on creating a compelling demo that showcases the product vision effectively.",

    "title": "For the project demo, a proper frontend is what creates the best impression. So, I've made the decision to start with it. I want you to use the `README.md` file for a clear idea of the frontend and backend (currently on hold due to time constraints) of our project. And as we are using flutter with mobile-first approach, I want you to build a good frontend for the project. \n\nDo the following:\n1. For the Home Page, make a Dashboard where the user can look into their subscription expenses for current month and the subscriptions the user had. \n2. Follow a Black and White color palette theme with Dark and Light mode support. Should have gradient feel with a rich font style. \n3. Should have a sidebar where the user can see their profile name and profile picture in the top (in circle), and access other sections like Settings, Subscriptions, Regional Services, Funds, Bundle Offers and Log Out with respective icons.\n4. Now for each section:\n- Settings: \n. Appearance Section\nTheme: Dark, Light, Follow System Theme\nFont size: 50 - 200%, Adaptable to system\n\n. Account Settings\nChange Password\nDelete Account\nand other relevant options\n\n. Subscriptions Section\nShows a list of apps you are subscribed to and currently active subscriptions and other related stuffs.\n\n. Regional Services Section\nMobile Recharge (Airtel, JIO, Vodafone)\nRegional OTTs\n\n. Funds Section\nThis section is used to check the current amount being stored as credits and can be redeemed to be used for paying subscriptions. Like a money storage system.\n\n. Bundle Offers\nSubscription Offers that the OTT platform owners give during special occasions\n\n. Log Out\nLogs out of the app and goes to User Login Page\n5. Now for the User Login Page (before the home page) It should show the username and password prompt with a login button. Should have a separate sign up option in the bottom. Make sure to follow the app theme mentioned.\n6. Due to time constraints, use placeholders wherever necessary for a good project demo showcase. Will work on backend later to reflect on the demo.\n7. Should have popus. You are open to implement it wherever required.\n\nHave to finish this project by tonight, to show the product tomorrow.",
